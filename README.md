Evasion is a garbage collected and compiled language written in Rust.
I have no intention of creating a production ready language but my aim is to understand compiler optimization and learn rust along the way :).

Write now, there is a repl where you can input basic arithmetic operation and boolean logic. My next step is to compile if/else expressions.
